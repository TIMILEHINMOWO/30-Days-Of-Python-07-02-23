This repository is a documentation of a 30 day challenge I'm starting on the 7th of February 2023.
Thank you to [Asabeneh](https://github.com/TIMILEHINMOWO/30-Days-Of-Python).

## Day 1:
### Introduction to python:
  - Python Installation
  - Python Basics
    - _Synthax_
    - _Comments_
    - _Data Types_
### [Day-1 Excersices](https://github.com/TIMILEHINMOWO/30-Days-Of-Python-07-02-23/blob/93dfbe6789a597b3c9e2cca3d61957857002a241/Day-1.py):
  - Performaing basic arithmetic operations
  - Identifying data types
  - Calculatiing [Eclidian distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance#:~:text=In%20mathematics%2C%20the%20Euclidean%20distance,being%20called%20the%20Pythagorean%20distance.)

## Day 2:
- Built in functions
- Variables
  - _Variable naming rules_
  - _Declaring multiple variables in a line_
- Data Types
- Checking Data Types & Casting
- Numbers

### [Day 2 Exercises]():
#### Exercises 1:
1. Declare a first name variable and assign a value to it
1. Declare a last name variable and assign a value to it
1. Declare a full name variable and assign a value to it
1. Declare a country variable and assign a value to it
1. Declare a city variable and assign a value to it
1. Declare an age variable and assign a value to it
1. Declare a year variable and assign a value to it
1. Declare a variable is_married and assign a value to it
1. Declare a variable is_true and assign a value to it
1. Declare a variable is_light_on and assign a value to it
1. Declare multiple variable on one line

#### Exercises 2:
1. Check the data type of all your variables using type() built-in function
1. Using the _len()_ built-in function, find the length of your first name
1. Compare the length of your first name and your last name
1. Declare 5 as num_one and 4 as num_two
    1. Add num_one and num_two and assign the value to a variable total
    2. Subtract num_two from num_one and assign the value to a variable diff
    3. Multiply num_two and num_one and assign the value to a variable product
    4. Divide num_one by num_two and assign the value to a variable division
    5. Use modulus division to find num_two divided by num_one and assign the value to a variable remainder
    6. Calculate num_one to the power of num_two and assign the value to a variable exp
    7. Find floor division of num_one by num_two and assign the value to a variable floor_division
1. The radius of a circle is 30 meters.
    1. Calculate the area of a circle and assign the value to a variable name of _area_of_circle_
    2. Calculate the circumference of a circle and assign the value to a variable name of _circum_of_circle_
    3. Take radius as user input and calculate the area.
1. Use the built-in input function to get first name, last name, country and age from a user and store the value to their corresponding variable names
1. Run help('keywords') in Python shell or in your file to check for the Python reserved words or keywords
